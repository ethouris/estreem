1. Problem in identifying the lexeme, if it has extenders

When extenders are added to candidates, then:
 - selecting the most unique lexeme causes that char:&32 is preferred over expected @whitespace
 - selecting the most general lexeme causes that @any is preferred over expected @whitespace

Possible solutions:

 - The 'expected' array must be filled in
 - The most general is preferred, unless it's @any
 - Multiple return is allowed and:
   - the identified lexeme is the longest and most unique
   - returned are all lexemes one after another in order:
     - first the most unique lexeme
	 - followed by its direct extenders (siblins in whatever order)
	 - followed by next level extenders until the most general extender
